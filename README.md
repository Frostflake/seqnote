# seqnote
This repository is a stub for a Python note taking software that will let you connect notes to other notes via custom relationships.
For example, you could have a note for "John" and a note for "Slime Rancher", and bridge them so that "John"->"Recommended"->"Slime Rancher", with the relationship itself being a note that can include comments.

Notes can be categorized into namespaces, such that the above example could be "Person:John"->"Relationship:Recommended"->"Game:Slime Rancher".
